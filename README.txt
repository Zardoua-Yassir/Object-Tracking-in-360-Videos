This repository provides the source code of the visual object tracker published in the paper "Joint Classification and Regression for Visual Tracking with Fully
Convolutional Siamese Networks", International Journal of Computer Vision - Springer, 2022. The main modification I made is adapting
this tracker to work on 360Â° videos, stored in equirectangular format as .mp4 files.

This model is currently being trained on a HPC (High Performance Computing) server that uses CPUs. Therefore, you need to adapt this
code to use cuda if you want to train it or run it on a Cuda GPU.

I've reused / modified the following scripts from the PySOT (Python Single Object Tracking) library:

pysot/core/config.py
pysot/datasets/augmentation.py
pysot/datasets/dataset.py
pysot/utils/bbox.py
pysot/utils/lr_scheduler.py
